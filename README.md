# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.ts
npx hardhat verify --network sepolia <contract address>
```

Scroll:
Note to the Scroll team: We tried verification with Scrollscan but continued to have issues with either Scrollscan / Blockscout being down or internet being down, so we were unable to do contract verification. See screenshot in top folder of repo called scrollscan_down.png

Here are the contract addresses - first is AdvertisableCoin, second is AdvertisableDao
